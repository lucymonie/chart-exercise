### Notes
I did this as quickly as possible as I have vanishingly small amounts of time at the moment. Ideally I would have liked to use an approach closer to functional programming. I'd like to put all the state into an object, get rid of the global variables (ugh!) and only use pure functions. The code is also repetitive - I can see several places where I could have created helper functions to reduce repetition.
